# COMMUNIGLOVE
in today’s digitally connected world, millions of individuals with speech or hearing impairments still face significant communication challenges. Traditional non-verbal tools such as sign language often require interpreters or mutual understanding, limiting independence and inclusivity. Moreover, in noisy or hazardous environments like factories or military zones, verbal communication becomes ineffective or impossible. There is a growing need for a real-time, user-friendly solution that bridges this communication gap and empowers individuals to express themselves confidently, regardless of their abilities or surroundings.

CommuniGlove is an innovative smart wearable designed to address these issues. This glove translates hand gestures and sign language into digital signals, enabling seamless interaction across various scenarios. It incorporates advanced sensors—including flex sensors, accelerometers, and gyroscopes—to track finger movements and hand positioning with precision.

Using machine learning algorithms, CommuniGlove recognizes predefined gestures and converts them into text or commands. Bluetooth connectivity allows real-time communication with smartphones or computers, while vibration feedback notifies users of successful actions or incoming messages. For added accessibility, integrated text-to-speech functionality enables vocal output, making the glove useful even for users who wish to communicate with those unfamiliar with sign language.

By combining gesture recognition, AI, and haptic feedback, CommuniGlove creates an intuitive, inclusive, and versatile communication platform, transforming the way people connect in both everyday and extreme environments.
